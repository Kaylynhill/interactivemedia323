	Being 
	strong
 	does 
 	not 
 	mean having position,
	
	It does not mean being tough,
	
	It does not mean being a bully,
	
	It does not mean defeating everyone either,
	
	If you want to be strong you have to,
	
		
	Believe
	

	In yourself,


	In your strength,
	

	In your hope, 
	

	In your dreams,
	
	In your capacity to be strong,
