Being strong does not mean having position,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
It does not mean being tough,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
It does not mean being a bully,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
It does not mean defeating everyone either,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
If you want to be strong you have to,
	<br>
	<br>
Believe
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
In yourself,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp 
In your strength,
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
In your hope, 
	<br>
	<br>
&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp &nbsp 
In your dreams,
	<br>
	<br>
In your capacity to be strong,
	<br>
	<br>
Believe
