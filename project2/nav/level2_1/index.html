<p> Being <strong>strong</strong> 
	<br>
	does <strong>not</strong> mean 
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp


having <strong>position,</strong> 
	<br>
It does <strong>not</strong> mean 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
 being <strong>tough</strong>,
	<br>
It does <strong>not</strong> mean
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
being a <strong>bully,</strong>
	<br>
It does <strong>not</strong> mean  
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
<strong>defeating</strong> everyone either,
	<br>
	<br>
If <em>you</em> want to be strong <em> you</em> have to,
	<br>
    <br>
<strong>BELIEVE</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
In your 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>self</strong>
	<br>
In your
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>strength</strong>
	<br>
In your
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
  <strong>hope </strong>
	<br>
In your 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>dreams</strong>
	<br>
In your 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
<strong>capacity</strong> to be strong,
	<br>
